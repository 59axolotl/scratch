v.1.1 features:

<!-- - End-to-end (E2E) authentication with password hashing using `bcrypt`
- Implemented Google Sign-in
- UI feedback for issues with sign-in, sign-up and adding boards
- Additional CRUD functionality: add/delete boards and columns
- Decoupling routing and state management in the front end to facilitate smooth page transitions and future scalability -->

----------------------

### Motivation and background

<!-- As part of the iteration project for the Codesmith Software Engineering Immersive Program, the group was looking for an opportunity to focus on authentication and implement further CRUD functionalities. We [forked](https://github.com/WCRI56-Team-GS/Scratch-Project) a project from an existing group that has potential for us to practice implementing authentication end-to-end as well as continuing on implementing the CRUD features that the previous group left off. -->

### Future iterations recommendations:

<!-- - Add ability to add and remove cards
- Use name from google sign-in instead of the email as username display on the UI
- Ensure session persists upon refreshes so the browser would not show a blank screen
- Refactor all front end fetch calls to using `axios`
- Refactor modal infrastructure in the front end to minimize prop drilling -->
